# Marlin configuration

The folder 2.0.9.3 contains configuration files downloaded from https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/2.0.9.3/Marlin

This folder contains configuration files originally downloaded from https://github.com/Printrbot/printrboardmodernmarlin/releases which are based on the 2.0.1 release.


## TODO

- [ ] Update the 2.0.1 configuration for 2.0.9.3
- [ ] Ensure that the bed size is correct
- [ ] Determine if I need to invert the y-axis and if so do it.
- [ ] End stops... anything required there?
- [ ] Ensure that the z-axis is setup for the 4-stop 8mm lead screw
