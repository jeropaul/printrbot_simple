# Marlin configuration

The folder 2.0.9.3 contains configuration files downloaded from https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/2.0.9.3/Marlin

This folder contains configuration files originally downloaded from https://github.com/Printrbot/printrboardmodernmarlin/releases which are based on the 2.0.1 release.

## Loading firmware

Easiest on a windows computer but there is a guide on the reprap forums https://reprap.org/wiki/Printrboard that links to github.com/Printrbot/FirmwareUpdat which doesn't exist but I did find http://mickbalaban.github.io/printrbot-firmware-updater/ which downloads the following http://github.com/mickbalaban/printrbot-firmware-updater/raw/gh-pages/pbFU_mac.zip

Yeah it sits where trying to download the latest firmware... Safe bet that path is not possible anymore.

So best bet is to get a winblows PC, install the Atmel updater (and JVM) and do it there. The details at [www.jdwallace.com](https://www.jdwallace.com/post/printrbot-simple-metal-marlin2) are spot on.
